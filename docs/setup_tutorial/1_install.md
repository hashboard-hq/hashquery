# Installing Hashquery

```{include} /_fragments/alpha_notice.md

```

Hashquery requires Python version 3.6 or above.
We recommend creating a fresh virtual environment for Hashquery, so that it
can't interfere with your other Python projects:

```bash
# Creating a virtual env with `conda`
conda create -n hashquery python=3.9.6
conda activate hashquery
```

Then install Hashquery with `pip` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hashquery/):

```bash
pip install hashquery
```
