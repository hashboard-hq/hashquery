# Roadmap

Hashquery is in a very early stage and so the primary focus is in
shipping a Beta version which solves a subset of problems well, and
offers a clear path to grow into more and more advanced use cases.

There are a variety of gaps which we have chosen not to exhaustively
document yet. In the short term, the focus is on:

- Reaching API stability
- Reaching parity with the Hashboard web app
- Evaluating and implementing new operators to unlock novel analytical patterns,
  similar to what we did with `Model.match_steps`
- Building an engaged community of data engineers to help us along the way
