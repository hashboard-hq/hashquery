Verify everything is hooked up correctly by copy-pasting the following into a new Python file, `quickstart.py`:

```python
from hashquery import *
print(project)
```

Run the file. If all went smoothly, you should see an index of your projectâ€™s contents.

```bash
$ python quickstart.py
Project: c-AlwxJ0wk123ab on https://hashboard.com
