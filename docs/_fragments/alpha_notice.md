Hashquery is currently in **early beta**. This means weâ€™ll do our best to
keep it stable, but there are significant caveats to keep in mind as you
try it out:

- Backwards compatibility will not be preserved between version upgrades,
  and you may need to update your package regularly to keep things working.
- You may encounter dialect-specific SQL syntax errors. If this happens,
  let us know by [reporting an issue](/project_info/feedback.md)
- There may be differences in the SQL logic generated by hashquery compared
  to the Hashboard app.
- Some errors might be hard to debug on your own (but we're happy to help!)
