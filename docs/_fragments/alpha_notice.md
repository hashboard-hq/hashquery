Hashquery is currently in **public preview**. Here are some caveats to keep in mind for early adopters:

- Backwards compatibility may not be preserved between version upgrades, and you may need to update your package regularly.
- There may be differences in the SQL logic generated by hashquery compared to the Hashboard app.
- You may encounter dialect-specific SQL syntax errors or other unexpected errors. If you come across one, let us know by [reporting an issue](https://github.com/hashboard-hq/hashquery/issues).
