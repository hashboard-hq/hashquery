## Submitting PRs

First off, thanks! That's awesome.

Please submit any Pull Requests against the `main` branch. Include a
description of what you're trying to accomplish and how.

At this time there are some dependencies for Hashquery (such as the compilation
server and unit tests) that are not included in this repository, which may
prevent you from fully implementing your desired change. In those situations,
a maintainer from Hashboard may commender to help finalize the feature end
to end.

This repo is currently synchronized from an internal one when we push new releases.
As a result, release commits will not include your name in the commit log.
